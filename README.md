# 🎲 Just One - Multiplayer Word Guessing Game

A cooperative word-guessing party game where players work together to help one player guess a mystery word using single-word clues. The twist? Duplicate clues are eliminated, so players must be creative and think uniquely!

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Cloudflare PartyKit](https://github.com/cloudflare/partykit) for real-time multiplayer functionality.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the client (Next.js)

```

Open http://localhost:3000 to play!
